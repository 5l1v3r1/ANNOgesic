Transap is a Transcriptome annotation pipeline.
It include many useful modules.
It is easy to run these modules seperately, in order to reach your specific goal.
It also can be used to run whole modules from RNA-seq data to any annotation information.
These modules are:
    set_up_analysis_folder
    get_input_files    
    get_target_fasta
    annotation_transfer
    TSS_prediction
    color_png_TSS
    Transcriptome_assembly
    Terminator_prediction
    cleavage_site_prediction
    color_png_cleavage_site
    utr_detection
    sRNA_detection
    promoter_detection
    CircRNA_detection
    Go_term
    sRNA_target
    operon_detection
    SNP_calling
    PPI_network
    Subcellular_localization


run.sh is a bash script for running Transap
Please put run.sh to the folder where you want to execute and store the information which gained through Transap.
get_package.sh is a bash script for download and install the packages which are required for running Transap.

optimize_TSSpredator.py (stored in bin) is a python script for optimize parameters of TSSpredator.

The details of these modules will coming soon...
