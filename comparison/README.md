The scripts for comparison between ANNOgesic predictions and several databases
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to make the comparison more reliable, please remove the non-expressed 
features of databases. Otherwise the performances may be influenced and can 
not reflect the real situation. For terminators, we also suggest to remove the 
terminators which does not contain a coverage significant decrease. For sORF, 
we used the study of Hemm et. al (2010) as benchmarking set. Please convert the 
sORF information to Gff3 format. Moreover, The number of CRISPRs and riboswitches 
are few in databases, the manual comparison can be implemented easily.
